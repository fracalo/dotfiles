`./all.sh` strives to run everything, but might not work :D

You must enable truecolor in tmux for nvim theme to work correctly.
In all.sh there is a check for that

## nvim
for packer to work it must be intalled from source inside the write path

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
  pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
this will bootstrap packer
